## Description

This is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that searches Google Books for a given book title, then displays the results. The challenge was to convert a functioning RESTful API application to a functioning GraphQL API application. I reinforced my understanding of GraphQL and React while doing this project.

The starter code was provided by the bootcamp but I refactored some code to convert to a GraphQL API.
